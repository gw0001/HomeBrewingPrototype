# HomeBrewingPrototype
A prototype of a homebrewing monitoring system. Contains a program developed for the Particle Argon microcontroller, which monitors temperature. Activates a heating element if the temperature is lower than the set temperature, or activates an alarm if the temperature is higher than the set temperature. A mobile application developed in Unity allows a user to monitor the temperature, as well as set temperatures and manually control components attached to the microcontroller.
